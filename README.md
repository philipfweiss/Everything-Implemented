## What is this?

I tend to learn the best by implementing things myself. 
I'd also ideally like to use these data structures in my other code. 

## What has been implemented so far? 

1. LinkedList

## What is to be implemented?

1. AVL Tree
2. Graph
3. Regular Heap
  - PriorityQueue
4. Binomial Heap
  - BinomialPQ
4. LinkedList
5. LRU Cache
6. Matrix
  - Matrix Algorithms

... and hopefully more!
