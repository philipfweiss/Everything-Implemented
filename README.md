## What is this?

I tend to learn the best by implementing things myself. 
I'd also ideally like to use these data structures in my other code. 

## What has been implemented so far? 

1. LinkedList

## What is to be implemented?

1. AVL Tree
2. Graph
  - Built In Graph Algorithms
3. Regular Heap
4. PriorityQueue
5. Binomial Heap
6. BinomialPQ
7. LinkedList
8. LRU Cache
9. Matrix
  - Built In Matrix Algorithms

... and hopefully more!
